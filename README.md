# üìä Electric Vehicle (EV) Market Data Analysis

This project presents an in-depth analysis of the electric vehicle (EV) market, including Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) and Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs). Using Tableau, the analysis explores key performance indicators (KPIs) to provide a comprehensive overview of market size, growth, technological advancements, and geographical distribution of EVs.

## üéØ Project Objectives

The primary goal of this analysis was to address key questions about the EV market:

* What is the total number of electric vehicles (BEVs and PHEVs) over time?
* What is the average electric range, indicating technological progress?
* How do BEVs compare to PHEVs in terms of market share and consumer preferences?
* Which states exhibit the highest concentration of EVs, and what are the related policy implications?
* Which vehicle makes and models dominate the market, revealing consumer trends?

## üìÅ Dataset & Fields

The analysis utilizes the `Electric_Vehicle_Population_Data.csv` dataset.

Key fields include:
* `Vehicle ID`: Unique identifier.
* `Model Year`: Vehicle model release year.
* `Make`: Manufacturer or brand.
* `Model`: Specific vehicle model.
* `Vehicle Type`: BEV or PHEV.
* `Electric Range`: Range on electric power alone (miles).
* `CAFV Eligibility`: Eligibility for Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle incentives.
* `State`: Vehicle registration state.

## üìà Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

The following KPIs were analyzed to understand EV market dynamics:

* **Total Vehicles:** Overall market size for both BEVs and PHEVs.
* **Average Electric Range:** To gauge technological advancements and efficiency.
* **Total BEV/PHEV Vehicles & % of Total:** To assess market share and dominance of fully electric vs. hybrid models.

## ‚ú® Key Insights

The analysis reveals several significant trends and observations:

* **Overall Market Growth:** The total number of EVs shows a steady upward trend from 2011, peaking significantly in **2023 with 37,079 vehicles**.
* **Average Electric Range:** The average electric range across all vehicles is **67.83 miles**, highlighting their practicality for daily use.
* **BEV Dominance:** Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) significantly outweigh Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs), with **116,750 BEVs (77.61%)** compared to **33,672 PHEVs (22.39%)** of the total 150,422 electric vehicles.
* **Geographical Concentration:** **Washington State** stands out with a significantly higher number of EVs (**150,082**), likely due to favorable state policies and incentives. Conversely, many central and southern states show very low adoption rates.
* **Manufacturer Dominance:** **Tesla** holds a commanding lead with **52.70% market share** (68,943 vehicles). Nissan (10.32%) and Chevrolet (9.19%) are the next major players.
* **Popular Models:** The **Tesla Model Y** and **Tesla Model 3** are the top-performing models, reinforcing Tesla's strong market presence. The presence of models from Nissan, Chevrolet, and Volkswagen indicates a diverse and competitive market.
* **CAFV Eligibility:** A significant portion of vehicles, **77.61%**, are eligible for Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle (CAFV) incentives, reflecting a positive trend towards environmental sustainability.
